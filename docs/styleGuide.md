## Styling Guide

Our coding conventions for *comments* are going to be based off of [Google Githubs Javascript Coding Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-comments)

All opening brackets will be preceded with a space or an opening brace.

All files will use 2 space idents unless it was a pregenerated file through angular 2.

- Pregenerated files are located inside the 'angular-src' folder with the exceptions of 
	- angular-src/src/app/components/ (all files ending in .html or .ts not .spec.ts)
	- angular-src/src/app/guards/
	- angular-src/src/app/services/ (all files ending in .ts not .spec.ts)
